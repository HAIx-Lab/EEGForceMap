# EEGForceMap
This git file is an official repository of the work "Improving Continuous Grasp Force Decoding from EEG with Time-Frequency Regressors and Premotor-Parietal Network Integration" by Parth G. Dangi and Yogesh K. Meena, which has been accepted to the Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC) conference, 2025. 
It contains all the source code developed by the authors, including the regressors integrated with the 'EEGForceMap' pipeline, codes required to visualise features and perform post-hoc analysis. The data used in these experiments is collected by Luciw et al. in 2014, where EEG and kinetic data from 12 participants were collected during grasp-and-lift tasks with different conditions. The DOI of the dataset and the data selected is given in the ReadMe document in the Code folder. The data folder contains the official results obtained from the experiments which has led to the conclusions given in the paper. These results can be used for validation and comparison. Please acknowledge the paper after referring this file.
